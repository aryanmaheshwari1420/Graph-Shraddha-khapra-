 Topological sorting : It is a linear order of vertices such that every directed edge u->v,
                       the vertex u comes before v in the order.


2. Topological sorting performed for the (DAG) means for directed acyclic graph.

3.  Creating graph using ArrayList is quite effecient as compared to use with the adjacency matrix.
    because adjacency matrix contain all the information of nodes that are not connected to it also.
    while in ArrayList it contain the information only for those nodes that are directly connected to it.

4. Time complexity of creating graph using ArrayList<>() is O(x) where x denotes the no of nodes that are directly
   connected to it.  // constant time

5.  Time complexity of creating graph using Adjacency matrix is O(v) where v denotes the no of all nodes . // linear time and space contain o(V^2)
